Objects

Create an object that describes a train ticket and stores it in the ticket variable. The object must have three fields:

    starting station (key name from, and as a value, give the name of the nearest station in your area)
    end station (key name to, and as a value, give any other station within 100 km)
    the price of the ticket (key name price, and as a value, give the amount you would like to pay for this ticket)

The object must be created using curly brackets, in which all fields will be listed immediately. Then display the values of all the fields of the ticket on the console.

Declare an empty object and save it to a person variable. Using dot notation, add firstName and lastName fields to the object by entering your data as values. It will try to display the individual fields on the console.
